Music quiz
==========

This is a small Django application for playing musical quizzes.
Website plays a song and visitor must guess what it is. This application
uses embedded (and hidden) youtube.com videos as a source for music and 
last.fm to discover titles of the songs.

Most of the quiz rules like timing are implemented only on client side 
with Javascript. Also visitor can easily find the correct answer by 
looking at the HTML source code, but this game is still fun to play.

I have not tested this website on anything but Firefox 3.6.
